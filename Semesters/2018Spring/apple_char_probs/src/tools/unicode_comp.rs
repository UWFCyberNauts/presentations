/*
 * Program: unicode_comp.rs
 * Author: Michael Mitchell
 * Description: This program spits out the Unicode escape characters that can be used
 *              to create the character or phrase that can be passed to it via 
 *              the command line or during runtime. This program was created as a
 *              utility to analyze the Apple జ్ఞ problem. This program makes a best
 *              effort attempt to perfectly preserve the input.
