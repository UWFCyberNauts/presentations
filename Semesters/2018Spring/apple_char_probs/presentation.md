## Apple's character problems.

This presentation went over the problems apple is having rendering certain
characters in certain Unicode character sets, how it is affecting 
customers, why Apple should've been much quicker to respond to this, 
and why Apple should care more.

you will find anything I did to make analyzing Apple's recen't character
problem easier.
