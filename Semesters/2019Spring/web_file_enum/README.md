## Web File Enumeration Presentation
This presentation focuses on the useful art of enumerating subdirectories
and files on a Web Server.

The presentation will speak to several good, well known tools. Namely
[EroDir](https://github.com/PinkP4nther/EroDir),
[gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster), and
[DIRB](http://dirb.sourceforge.net/).
The presentation will cover why these tools are useful, how they
relate to both the Cyber Security industry and CTFs, and the general
usefulness of HTTP methods.
